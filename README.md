# Full-Stack Library Management System (LMS)

## 📌 Project Overview
**Problem:** 
Traditional library management involves manual book tracking, which is slow, prone to errors, and makes it difficult to manage inventory and student records efficiently.

**Tech Stack:**
* **Frontend:** React.js (User Interface)
* **Backend:** Node.js & Express.js (API Logic)
* **Database:** SQL Server (Data Management)
